## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins by thoroughly understanding the users' pain points, goals, and expected outcomes. This is often done through interviews, surveys, and feedback sessions where users describe their challenges and the value they expect from a solution. Once I have that information, I distill it into user stories, which are concise descriptions that capture the who, what, and why of a feature from the user’s perspective. Creating user stories helps by breaking down complex user requirements into manageable tasks that development teams can focus on. The format ("As a [user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]") ensures the development team is aligned with the user's needs. These stories prioritize functionality based on user value, making it easier to guide development toward features that will have the most impact. Ultimately, user stories provide a clear connection between user needs and how they will be implemented in the program, ensuring that the final product serves the intended purpose.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs revolves around incremental and iterative development. I prefer to start small, focusing on creating a minimum viable product (MVP) that can quickly be tested and refined. This approach allows me to gather user feedback early and often, ensuring the program meets user expectations as it evolves. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate several key Agile processes in my development work, such as:

Sprints: Organizing work into short, time-boxed cycles (sprints) to deliver functional increments of the product at regular intervals.
Daily Standups: Holding brief, focused meetings with the team to share progress, identify roadblocks, and keep everyone aligned.
Continuous Integration: Ensuring that code is integrated and tested frequently to detect bugs early and avoid integration headaches later.
Retrospectives: Regularly reflecting on what worked well and what could be improved after each sprint to foster continuous improvement.
These Agile practices help me stay flexible, adapt to changing requirements, and keep the focus on delivering value to the customer.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means more than just writing code—it involves communication, collaboration, and supporting the team’s goals. A good team member listens actively, shares ideas constructively, and is open to feedback. They take ownership of tasks while being mindful of how their work integrates with the rest of the team's efforts. Helping others, whether through code reviews or problem-solving, shows a willingness to contribute to the team's success as a whole. Furthermore, a good team member is flexible, understanding that priorities can shift, and is ready to pivot when needed. The ability to collaborate effectively, show empathy for teammates, and contribute positively to the team dynamic is essential for delivering high-quality software in an Agile environment.
